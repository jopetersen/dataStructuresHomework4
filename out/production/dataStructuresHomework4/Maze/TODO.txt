Problem:
- The aim of this assignment is to use recursion and backtracking to find a path through a maze.
  If you are attempting to walk through a maze, you will probably walk down a path as far as you
  can go. Eventually, you will reach your destination or you won’t be able to go any farther. If you
  can’t go any farther, you will need to consider alternative paths. Therefore we need to be able
  to systematically perform trial and error search. Backtracking is a way for doing just this. It is a
  systematic, nonrepetitive approach to trying alternative paths and eliminating them if they don’t
  work. Recursion allows you to implement backtracking in a relatively straightforward manner.
  Each activation frame is used to remember the choice that was made at that particular decision
  point. After returning from a recursive call you can perform other recursive calls to try out different paths



 High level:
 - Use recursion to try different paths.
    - If the path is not valid, eliminate it.
